List of relavent files:
    - src - directory to hold all c source files in the program 
        - client.c - application code for the client side program
        - server.c - application code for the server side program
        - netutils.c - shared functions for the client and server side programs
    - include - directory for all header files in the program
        - pa1.h - types and function declarations for both programs
        - config.c - configuration for both the client and server side programs.
    - obj - directory that object files are placed in on compilation
    - Makefile - contains targets to compile all necessary files for the program.

Compilation instructions:
    Use the makefile for compilation - 

        - Both client and server - run 'make' on the command line
        - client - run 'make client' on the command line
        - server - run 'make server' on the command line
    
    To clean up object/executable files, run 'make clean'

Configuration file: 
    - Configurations are all in 'config.h'.
    - Change the values after each of the constant definitions to configure.
    - SERVER_PORT is the port the server's socket binds to
    - SERVER_ADDR is the server's IP address
    - MAX_LINE is the maximum amount of bytes to send in each packet
    - HEADER_SIZE is the size of a header in bytes

Running instructions: 
    - The server needs to run before the client.
    - The server executable file is for running the server side of the program
        - To run, enter './server' from the server executable's current directory
    - The client executable file is for running the client side of the program
        - To run, enter './client' from the client executable's current directory
